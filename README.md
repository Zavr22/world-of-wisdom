Why I used hashcash?

The algorithm works by requiring the user to perform a cryptographic hash function on a block of data, such as a transaction. The output of the hash function must meet certain criteria in order to be considered valid. Specifically, the output must be below a certain target value, which is adjusted dynamically to maintain a consistent level of difficulty.

The advantage of using hashcash is that it is relatively easy to implement, yet still provides a high level of security. Additionally, because the difficulty of the algorithm can be adjusted based on the network's capacity, it is able to maintain a consistent rate of block creation without requiring excessive computational power.
